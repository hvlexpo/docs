# Vision

This document specifies our groups vision for the project. We will be building a voting app for an event held at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences showcasing various student projects.

## Requirements analysis

Users will be able to scan QR codes using an app at stands, and then be presented with a view of the project and the ability to vote on them.

A website will show an overview of which projects have received the most and highest votes.

## Domain model

The application will require three classes; exhibition, user, and vote.
